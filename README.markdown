# CFerous #

CFerous is an unfortunately named ColdFusion wrapper for the Posterous API.

## Goal ##
I use Posterous for several blogs that I manage and, in many case, I prefer to do this not from the Posterous web site; rather, from my specific sites or applications. 

I will develop a series of wrappers for the Posterous API in the following order: 
* Users
* Sites
* Pages
* Posts
* Tags
* External Autopost Sites
* Comments
* Link Categories
* Links 
* Site Profile
* Contributors
* Subscribers
* Likes
* Theme
